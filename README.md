# Real-Time-Clock-with-Temperature-Monitoring-And-Editable-Date-Time-Interface-on-LPC2148
The Real-Time Clock (RTC) with Temperature Monitoring on the LPC2148 integrates precise timekeeping with environmental temperature sensing. Users can easily edit and set date and time through an intuitive interface. This versatile system is ideal for applications requiring both accurate timing and temperature data tracking.
Ihave proposed all the code that consist of keil and proteus software to avoid  the extension problem.
